Narendra Modi seeks to bolster ties with US via trade and energy deals - Financial Times

India has been making progress on a deal to ease the country's tough trade sanctions on China. The Indian government has already signed a deal to allow Chinese firms to operate in the country, but it is still an imperfect agreement. In September, the two sides agreed to establish a joint trade zone to tackle the trade dispute. The deal is expected to be finalised in September. A close ally of Modi's, the US state department has said the agreement will not include any trade restrictions.
