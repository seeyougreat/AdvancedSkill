The group's members have been protesting Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.

The group's group, which has been criticized for its support for Trump's agenda, has been staging protests in cities across America, and its members have been calling for his release.

The group of activists are led by former American ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.

In a blog post, Haley said the group's actions in North Carolina and New York "have caused many to fear that the United States will soon be the last place on earth where oil and gas can be exported to a global economy that is threatened by climate change."
