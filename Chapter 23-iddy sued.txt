Diddy was born Jan. 3, 1984, in Miami, Fla. and is a former model. She recently revealed she was molested by former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.

Diddy's lawyer, Robert F. Kennedy, said in a statement that the case is "a sad day for the Miss Universe. We are saddened by the loss of a beautiful, inspiring figure who will be missed by so many. She has provided all she has to the world, and we are honored to stand with her in this difficult time."

Trump and Machado met on the set of the MTV reality show "The Apprentice."

Trump also spoke with Machado's attorney, Michael S. Schneider, in an exclusive interview on the Today show.

Trump then accused Machado of "lying to get her into trouble."

"She was a beautiful, beautiful woman, very very beautiful," Trump said. "She was very beautiful and very beautiful."

The two then agreed to meet on the set of "The Apprentice," the reality show, in an effort to find a way to make their relationship work.

Trump also said he believes the former Miss Universe will find her "better in time."

"You're going to find a better woman than she is, that's a beautiful woman, better than she is, and she's going to go up to the top, and she's going to be better than she is," he said.

Machado and Trump met in the late 1990s at the Miss Universe pageant.

The former Miss Universe's bodyguard told TMZ in June that Machado told her that Donald Trump was watching and "was like, 'I'm not going to go with you. I'm not going to go with you. You're not going to go with me. You're not going to go with me,'" Trump said.

According to her lawsuit, and multiple legal sources, Machado was a "lover, a prostitute, a prostitute, a prostitute. It was just that she was a prostitute."
