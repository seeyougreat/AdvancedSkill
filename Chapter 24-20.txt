Leaked Galaxy S25 Ultra images seem to confirm Samsung's self-sabotaging move - PhoneArena has also been able to confirm that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a true 3.5mm device.

A statement from Samsung's website said the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be released in January 2015 and will be available at all Galaxy S models (see below).

The company also stated that the device will be available in black, white and grey colours. The company has yet to confirm a release date for the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

The Galaxy S25 Ultra is now available in black and white and grey colours.

The Galaxy S25 Ultra also offers an NFC charging icon, which Samsung confirmed to be a "new feature".

We know that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be available in black and white and grey colours.

This isn't the first time Samsung has hinted that the Galaxy S25 is a 3.5mm smartphone, but it's rather unlikely that the company will be able to officially reveal the device before the end of 2015
