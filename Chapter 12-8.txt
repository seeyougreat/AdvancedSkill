The Texans and Raiders are now tied in the final week of the regular season, and the Raiders are tied with the Bills for the longest playoff drought in NFL history with 438 games remaining.

The Cardinals have a better record against the Patriots and Saints than their opponent at home, and the Browns have allowed at least 14 points per game in three of their past four meetings.

The Texans will be without quarterback Robert Griffin III for the first time this season while facing the Steelers.

The Seahawks are still the only team to have won five straight playoff games, and the Browns are tied for fifth in the AFC South.

"I'm really excited," Colts coach Chuck Pagano said of the potential matchup. "You know, the fact that they've won the division and they're playing the Patriots in our division makes it a little bit of a no-brainer to play in the Super Bowl.

The Seahawks are 11-2.

The Bengals and Cowboys are tied for second with six games remaining.

If the Bengals lose, they would tie for the NFC South lead with the Cowboys.

The Cowboys have lost three of four and the Lions have lost three of four.

The Jaguars are 15-1 since the start of
