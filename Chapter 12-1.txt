LG and Samsung are adding Microsoftâ€™s Copilot AI assistant to their TVs - The Verge has learned.

It's called the Samsung AI Assistant, and it's supposed to help with the problem of tracking your TV's location on your computer. The company said that the AI assistant is capable of picking up on a TV's location and automatically alerting you when it's time to turn on your TV.

Samsung also says that it is "reviewing" the AI assistant, which will allow it to help people with TV problems and find out if they are in danger.

The AI Assistant isn't limited to AI assistants. Samsung also added that it will work with other smart TVs too.

"We are working with other manufacturers to improve the AI assistant," it said in a statement. "We are aware of issues and will make adjustments in the coming days."

It's unclear how the AI assistant's capabilities will be used by Samsung's competing devices. According to the Verge, some manufacturers may be working with third parties to bring the AI assistant to their TVs, making it possible to get similar features from Samsung.

Samsung's AI Assistant is not the only smart TV that may be coming to the market next year. Earlier this year, Samsung introduced the Samsung Gear VR in collaboration with LG to offer better entertainment experiences. The Gear VR is the first smart TV to integrate Samsung's AI assistant into its device.

The Samsung Gear VR is also expected to be the first smart TV to incorporate the Samsung AI assistant. Samsung's Gear VR is the first smart TV to use Samsung's AI assistant.

Samsung has been working on adding the Samsung AI assistant to its TVs for over a year now. It also has been working on the Android Wear smart TV with Samsung, but the Samsung Gear VR doesn't have enough battery capacity to support the Android Wear smart TV.
