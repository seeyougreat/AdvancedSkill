Christina Haack Removes Another Tattoo Related to Ex Josh Hall: ‘Burns So Good’ - AOL

In an email to staff, the couple said they were "pleased" to have survived the storm, which they believe will take the lives of at least two dozen people.

"We have been praying for this for years, and we are so thankful," they said in the email. "We would like to say we are praying for everyone involved in the destruction of this place."

The couple's home in the area was on fire, and the couple's brother, Michael, said he and his family had been in the house about four hours before the storm began.

"We didn't know when it would hit, but we knew it was going to happen," Michael said. "It was just a very sad day. I really don't know what to do. I'm just praying."

The couple's three-bedroom home on the street outside of the house was being built in the 1800s, and the couple said they could have a home nearby, but they were unable to build one in the 1990s.

The couple said they found a sign on the front door that said: "Do not burn your home."

The couple said they "have been waiting for this for so long," and they "will never let this happen again."

The couple said they spent more than $500 to rebuild the house, which was built in the 1800s and was built in the 20th century.

The couple said they were "grateful for the support and support of everyone involved."

The couple said they felt safe in their home and hope an emergency evacuation was ready within 24 hours of the storm.

"This is not a good place," they said. "We are so thankful for this and so thankful for all the people we have loved and loved. It is hard to believe that we could have survived this."
