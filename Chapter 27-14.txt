On Wednesday, the White House announced that the President would sign an order, which would close the Education Department's Office of Management and Budget and the National Institutes of Health's director of science program.

Trump's order temporarily blocked federal funding to the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies from going into effect until June 30, five days before the start of the federal government's fiscal year. The order also banned funding for the National Science Foundation from going into effect until July 1, two weeks before the start of the federal government's fiscal year.
