Lakers get first big performance from Luka Dončić in win over Nuggets - Yahoo Sports

With the Nuggets in the hunt for the playoffs, it's no surprise that rookie guard Joel Embiid is taking a shot at playing in the playoffs.

In his first NBA season, Embiid, who plays for the Chicago Bulls, averaged 1.9 points, 1.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 2.0 steals while shooting 56 percent from the field.

If the Nuggets do manage to finish in the top five in the Western Conference, they'll be the third team since 1996 to make the playoffs. The last time was 2008-09, when the New York Knicks won the title by a combined score of 50-45.

Embiid is averaging 11.3 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 17.5 minutes per game this season.

The Nuggets are the only team since the start of the 1994-95 season to average more than 11 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game.

Denver's season has been one of the most frustrating in recent memory. The Nuggets are 3-12 this season in the playoffs, the only team to finish in the top three in that span this season.

The Nuggets are also 12-3 during the regular season.

In the playoffs, the Nuggets have lost five straight. The last time the Nuggets won three straight was back in 2013-14.

The Nuggets have also lost five of their last six and are 6-2 in the NBA postseason.
