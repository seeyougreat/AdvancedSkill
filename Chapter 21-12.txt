David Lynch, who brought surrealism into the cineplex, dies at 78 - The Washington Post reported. Lynch's "cineplex" was a place for artists to share their experiences, but it was also a place where they were encouraged to write new stories about their lives. Lynch was a writer who used a typewriter to write his book, "American Pie," and "Penguins of Madagascar," as well as "The Last Man On Earth," "The Naked and Famous," and "The Big Bang Theory."

He worked at the National Press Club in New York, where he studied art history and the history of writing and illustration. His work was also featured in a series of magazines, including Harper's, New York Times, and The New York Times Literary Supplement. He died at the age of 86, at his home in Long Island, New York, in 1986.

The original novel by Lynch, with his friend, William Peralta, was published in 1941. The novel's title is a reference to a line from Lynch's "American Pie" novel, which described an American family living in a cineplex.

Lynch was also an English artist, and a member of the group of American artists who made The Naked and Famous. His name is also known as "The Invisible Man" by Lynch.
