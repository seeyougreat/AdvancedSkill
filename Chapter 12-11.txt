Travis Kelce doesnâ€™t address possible retirement after Super Bowl LIX - NBC Sports Network.

"I think probably 10 years from now, I'm going to be a Hall of Famer," Kelce said. "I don't think we'll ever see a Hall of Fame until I'm 50 years old."

Kelce's time with the Giants wasn't as memorable, but he was a very special guy for being a member of the league's greatest locker room.

He was a Hall of Fame member from 1986 to 1990 and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1993.

He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1992.

Kelce is among a small group of Giants players who have been inducted into the Hall of Fame, as well as a few who have won the Hall of Fame in each of the past 10 years.

The Dallas Cowboys won the NFL's Super Bowl 56 in 2001, and the Los Angeles Rams with the 1994 Super Bowl 49.

Kelce played for the Giants, the Atlanta Falcons and the Chicago Bears from 1989 to 1991, as well as for the Chicago Bears from 1991 to 1992.

The Hall of Fame is the formal process established by each member of the NFL's Hall of Fame, who is chosen by the league's owners. The league had five members in 2002, five in 2006 and five in 2008.
