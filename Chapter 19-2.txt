New Superconductive Materials Have Just Been Discovered - WIRED

It may be too early to speculate on what they might be, but this may be the first new superconductive material to be discovered, and the first in a long line of new superconducting materials.

A team led by Thomas R. Laughlin, a professor of biological engineering and director of the Nano-Fiber Center at Johns Hopkins, has discovered a sub-atomic level of superconductive material, called quasicrystals, which are extremely high in quasicrystals.

Quasicrystals are extremely small, relatively thin, and have been discovered on Earth. Quasicrystals are also rare in nature, but are the only known superconducting material that has been found. But the discovery of quasicrystals has implications for the future of superconducting materials, said Laughlin.

"If quasicrystals are the first superconducting material, then we can look to the future for a new generation of superconducting materials," he said.

The research team found quasicrystals and their sub-atomic counterparts on the surface of a transparent diamond-like object in an extremely hot temperature range. The team discovered quasicrystals at about 10,000 degrees Celsius, and found that they are very
