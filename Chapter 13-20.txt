Heart disease remains the top cause of death in the U.S. - The Washington Post reports that a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 40 percent of the deaths in the U.S. from heart disease were by patients with a history of heart failure.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a federal agency, recently released its latest report on the health of American people. The report found that nearly 15 million Americans are on an elevated risk of heart disease, and that nearly half of those diagnosed with heart disease are women.

The CDC's report comes as the federal government continues to grapple with whether the health of Americans is at risk from a growing number of heart attacks and strokes. The government is urging insurers to offer plans which prevent heart attack and stroke at no cost to reduce the cost of their plans and to keep cost-sharing among insurers and patients.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement that, "This report highlights the potential health benefits of having a low-cost plan. It also shows that the increasing number of nonfatal heart attacks is an important contributor to the rise of stroke and heart disease mortality."

In a statement, the CDC said that, "We continue to believe that the number of heart attacks in the U.S. increases with the number of people on a low-cost plan."
