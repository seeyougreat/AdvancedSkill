US suspends military aid to Ukraine - Financial Times

HUNTSVILLE, Alabama - A U.S. military aid convoy is moving from Kuwait to South Sudan along the border of Sudan, the U.S. military announced Sunday.

The convoy will arrive at Sudan, according to an announcement by the Pentagon. It is being paid for by the U.S. Department of Defense.

The convoy will be heading to South Sudan, where it is being paid for by President Barack Obama's administration.

"The U.S. military is taking appropriate action to ensure that all its resources are used efficiently in South Sudan to support the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the country," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement.

"This is an important step to ensure that all U.S. military personnel and their families have access to safe and dignified passage to and from their country of origin to facilitate this process."

More than 2,000 people have been killed since January in Sudan's civil war.

The United States has stepped up its support to rebels fighting President Yoweri Museveni and his government.

Obama announced a $1bn aid package in December to help the rebels in northern Sudan.
