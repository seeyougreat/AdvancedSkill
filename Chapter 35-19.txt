Girl, 17, whose dad is lost in nightclub rubble spends birthday at scene - BBC News Online

This is the scene where a man has collapsed on to the pavement of a nightclub in central London.

The man was in a car with his mother and child when he collapsed.

He told the Mirror: "I had no idea he was going to make it to the ground. He was pretty sick. He had been on the car for seven hours at this point and he wasn't feeling well.

"I couldn't stop breathing as he was on the ground. I knew that he was going to make it up and he did.

"He was trying to get up to his knees but he was just starting to lose his balance and he was collapsing down. I think he was hit by the tyre and he landed on the pavement.

"I think he was thrown up by the impact of the tyre. He's got a head injury and there's blood all over his face."

Neighbours said the young man was taken to hospital by a friend who was on an emergency flight from Bristol.

It is understood the person was at the scene and had been taken to hospital with injuries from the attack.

Detectives will now examine CCTV footage from the scene and will be able to conduct a full investigation.
