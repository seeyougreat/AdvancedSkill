Giant waves kill at least 1 in Ecuador, close ports in Peru - CBS News, April 14, 2015

President Rafael Correa has been accused of using a "toxic" chemical in the Ecuadorian capital, San Juan, in a bid to kill off a deadly virus that killed at least 17 people in the past year.

The deadly virus, known as H5N1, was discovered in March in the city of Santa Barbara and spread from the city to more than a dozen other cities in the region.

The virus, which in recent years has killed around 100 people, was discovered in the city of San Juan, where Correa's government is located.

Correa has been on a visit to the United States this year to try to fight the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

The virus is also active in many parts of Africa, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mozambique, and Guinea.

H5N1 is a deadly virus that is currently being used in many countries in the world, including in the United States.

It has been used to kill off H5N1 in the United States, and can be lethal to pregnant women.

The virus has been used by the state of Texas to kill off the virus in Texas, and has been used in some cases to kill off some of the H5N1 gene.
