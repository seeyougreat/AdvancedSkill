A New York Times investigation found that two of the three former NFL players who accused President Trump of sexually assaulting them were not aware of the charges until they were caught.

The Times reported that former New York Giants linebacker Adam Gase and former Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Nick Foles testified against Trump on Jan. 9 in New Hampshire.

In the New Hampshire hearing, Trump spoke about the case, saying he "couldn't remember a single time" when he did encounter sexual assault.

"I have to be honest, I never even met him," Trump said.

"You had a guy who was on the team? You had a guy who was in the locker room? You had a guy in the locker room? I don't remember a single time, but you had a guy who was on the team?" Trump said, adding, "I've never met anybody more horrible than that."
