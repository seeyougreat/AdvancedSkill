Rapid spread of H5N1 bird flu through California dairy herds suggests unknown paths of transmission - STAT

A new study has found that the virus that causes the flu is spread through dairy herds in the state of California.

A team of scientists from the University of California, San Diego, analyzed data from more than 100 California dairy herds from 2011 to 2014 and found that the virus had been moving west through the California dairy herds, where it was not seen in other countries.

In the study published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers found that the virus is spread by the U.S. dairy herds, which are much larger than those in the other states.

The researchers said the findings suggest that the virus is spreading through dairy herds in California.

FDA officials have not issued any warnings about the potential health risks of the virus, but they have warned against consuming milk that is high in the virus.

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the virus has been involved in more than 40,000 deaths in the United States between 2001 and 2012.

A National Institutes of Health spokeswoman said the agency is "committed to reducing the use of illicit, unapproved, or unsafe drugs and products."
