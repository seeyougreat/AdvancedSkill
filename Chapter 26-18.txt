2 dead, 18 hurt after small plane crashes into building in Southern California - ABC News

A Boeing 767-200ER, which crashed into a South Carolina construction site on Tuesday afternoon, was found intact.

The plane was flying at an altitude of about 150 miles (250km) when it crashed on a runway near the state capital, Charleston, state officials said.

The plane was carrying six people and two of its crew members. All had injuries.

"This is the heaviest plane I've ever flown in the air," said Capt. John E. Tuck, the state's deputy aviation chief.

The South Carolina Department of Transportation said the plane was not involved in the accident.
