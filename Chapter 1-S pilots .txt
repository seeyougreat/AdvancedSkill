US pilots shot down over Red Sea in 'friendly fire' - BBC.com, 8 May 2013.

The US had used "friendly fire" against North Korea in the past, but so did the UK and France, after US President George W Bush ordered a global missile strike on the country in 2001.

A US Air Force statement said: "We are confident that the US will use all available means to defend ourselves.

"The US should not interfere with the US-led UN Security Council or any other UN body in any way or form. The US and the UK have both said the same thing.

"We will not be using any force to stop the North Korean nuclear programme. We will not be using force to punish the DPRK for any violation of its UN resolutions."

The US has been accused of using a range of tactics to try and persuade its North Korean neighbours to back down from its nuclear ambitions.

Last week, the US denied the claims - saying the missile had simply been launched from its base in the Korean People's Army in the Demilitarised Zone, or DMZ.

The missile, which has been launched from a US ship, fired three times at the US coast.

The US has repeatedly denied the claims.
