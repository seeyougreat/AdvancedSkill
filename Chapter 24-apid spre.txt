Rapid spread of H5N1 bird flu through California dairy herds suggests unknown paths of transmission - STAT

Aerial photos released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) show a swarm of bird flu-like strain-4 strains (H5N1, H5N2, H5N4, and H5N7) spread through California dairy herds in the Northern Hemisphere this summer. (NASA/JPL-Caltech)"

"The H5N1 strain is one of the most widely dispersed strains in the United States. It is a very common disease affecting the population of the northern United States, primarily in California and the Southwest. H5N1 has been shown to cause serious health problems, including pneumonia, liver inflammation, and gastrointestinal problems."

"We have to look at the pathogenesis of the virus," said University of California, Santa Barbara microbiologist Richard DeWitt, MD, a co-author on the study. "It seems unlikely that the H5N1 strain is directly related to the flu. The H5N2 strain is also present in the same places in the United States as the H5N1 strain. And H5NV is also present in the same places as the H5N1 strain."

"In the past, we have seen outbreaks of H5N1 in California, but only in the Northern Hemisphere," said De
