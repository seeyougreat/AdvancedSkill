Dominique Pelicot: Who is the man who plotted his wife's mass rape? - BBC.com

"This was a very sophisticated technique. It was not a way of thinking about a woman that was so small.

"So it was not an attempt to get a woman to act as if she was the victim of a sexual assault."

The rape was carried out during a party in the late 1990s in a hotel room in the city of Paris, he added.

"It was a very sophisticated technique. It was not a way of thinking about a woman that was so small.

"I can't believe what I saw. This was a very sophisticated technique. It was not a way of thinking about a woman that was so small.

"I don't know what happened. I could not believe it. But this is very much a very sophisticated technique."

It is believed the 29-year-old is currently on trial
