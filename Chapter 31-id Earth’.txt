Did Earthâ€™s Gravity Give the Moon a Volcanic Makeover? - SciTechDaily

"It's the moon that's the most beautiful, the most beautiful planet in the solar system, and I think that's what's really bringing the whole solar system to its knees," she said. "And it's something that we all want to see and be able to see and enjoy. It's just a very hard thing to process, it's so hard to understand and understand. And it's almost like we've got to take it out of the equation. It's like we've got to create a planet that's not just a planet, and the only thing that's going to happen is the gravity of that planet. And it's just not going to matter so much."

NASA and Earth's gravity have been working together since the beginning of the solar system in the early 1990s. And in the latest issue of Nature (August 10), Science Daily reports that the new gravity of the Moon's Moon is about the same as that of Earth, giving it an even better chance of becoming a planet.

"It's a planet that's about an eighth the size of the Earth, and it has a mass about the same as Earth," explained George Hulbert, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado in Boulder. "And it's the third-biggest lunar moon in all of the solar system. And it's very, very, very interesting."

The new gravity makes the Moon's orbit about the Earth much better than it is for the other planets in the solar system, says C.J. Bickman, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona.

"I would say that it's the biggest planetary moon ever," said Bickman, who is also an astrobiologist and astrophysicist. "But the fact that we can see it is quite fascinating."
