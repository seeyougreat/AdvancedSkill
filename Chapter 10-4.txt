US measles cases reach 5-year high; 15 states report cases, Texas outbreak grows - Ars Technica

"For the first time in nearly 20 years, measles outbreaks in states that have legalized the medical use of the vaccine are on the rise in recent years," says Dr. William F. Nesbitt, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Irvine.

There are about 200 measles cases in Arizona alone. Although measles is not fully eradicated, the infection has spread to other parts of the country, causing many, including the United States, to experience outbreaks as the outbreak worsens. As measles spreads, it has become more difficult to control, but the number of people who get infected is growing, and the number of cases is decreasing.

Dr. Nesbitt says the CDC is working to identify and prevent the most common measles transmission in the United States of the year, but it is also working to make the vaccine available and effective.

The CDC's new measles surveillance system, developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be introduced this year in the United States, and the program is expected to be rolled out in states that have already enacted the vaccine.

"We think the real challenge is finding vaccines that are safe and effective," Nesbitt says. "We will have to figure out how to make sure that we have the right amount of vaccine, and I think that that's going to come as a challenge.

"This is the first step in a long-term program that we're going to start to look at."
