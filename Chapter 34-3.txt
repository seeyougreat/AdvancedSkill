Pulisic return gives U.S. big presence in Super Cup - ESPN

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A year after the U.S. and Germany won the CONCACAF Champions League, the U.S. has become a major soccer nation.

Now, with a team like Brazil and the U-20 World Cup underway, the U.S. will be playing a major role in world soccer.

The U.S. now has 30 international matches played, one in the next four years and one in 2018.

"We really want to make sure our players have the best possible training and training facilities, so we have to be ready to play," said U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann. "Now we're going to be able to compete in the World Cup."

Klinsmann said the U.S. will play nine matches this season.

"There's still a long way to go. We're going to have a short schedule, but with that being said, we're looking for something different than just a one-game schedule."

While Klinsmann said the U.S. has not decided what to do with the World Cup, the U.S. is working on developing its next moves. The U.S. was a main force in the World Cup.

"We have to win the next four games and we're certainly looking to win the next four international games," Klinsmann said.

The U.S. will play two games against the new group of six teams from Brazil and Germany. The U.S. is looking to qualify for the next World Cup in 2019.

The U.S. has played against nine U.S. opponents in World Cup qualifiers, including three of the last five. The U.S. also has two matches against the United States in the 2019 World Cup qualifying tournament.
