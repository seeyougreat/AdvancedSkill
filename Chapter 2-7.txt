Brown's mother, Karen Brown, said she was at the home to watch her son, who is six years old, play in a park when the shooting happened.

"She was there and she was doing what she was supposed to do," Brown said.

Brown's father, Michael Brown Jr., told News 5 LA he was in his driveway in the parking lot when he saw the shooting and called the cops.
