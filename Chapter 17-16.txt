Chris Mason: A clear nod to demands for a new child abuse inquiry - BBC.com has learned.

He said: "It's clear that the child abuse of children in our care is a growing problem.

"For many of the victims, there will be a lack of support and we are working with parents and senior staff to bring them home safely, and to ensure they are able to continue the education they need to thrive.

"The UK is a very special place and it is my hope that this will lead to more victims and more progress in the care of children."

Mr Mason said: "It is important that parents, teachers and administrators are aware of the growing problem which threatens to destroy the reputation of parents and their child.

"The UK has an appalling record of child abuse and the growing problem is one of the most significant in the world.

"We need to take action urgently to ensure all children and young people have safe homes, secure schools, safe work environments, and safe homes for their families.

"It is imperative that parents, teachers and administrators are given the support they need to ensure a safe and successful life for their children."

The Government says it is committed to tackling the problem in a clean and compassionate manner.
